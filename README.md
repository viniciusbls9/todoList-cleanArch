# todoList-cleanArch

This README document provides an overview of the "Senior" Todo List application, which is built using VueJS with TDD (Test-Driven Development) and follows Clean Architecture principles. It also highlights the ease of transitioning from VueJS to ReactJS while maintaining TDD and adhering to best software development practices.

## Clean Architecture
The "Senior" Todo List project follow to the principles of Clean Architecture, which helps in achieving code modularity, flexibility, and maintainability. The application is structured into distinct layers, each with a specific responsibility:

### Domain Layer:
- Contains the core business logic and entities.
### Application Layer:
- Implements the use cases and orchestrates the interactions between different components.
### Infrastructure Layer:
- Handles external dependencies, such as APIs and databases.

This separation of concerns enables easier testing, extensibility, and decoupling between different layers.

## Transitioning to ReactJS
While the "Senior" Todo List is developed using VueJS, transitioning to ReactJS with TDD and following best software development practices is relatively straightforward. Both VueJS and ReactJS share similarities in terms of component-based architecture and reactive rendering.

To migrate to ReactJS:

- [x] Create React components that mirror the functionality and structure of the Vue components.
- [x] Port the existing tests to React Testing Library or Jest.
- [x] Refactor any Vue-specific syntax or APIs to their React equivalents.
- [x] Test thoroughly to ensure the application behaves as expected.

By following these steps, you can leverage your TDD experience and the knowledge gained from developing with VueJS to smoothly transition to ReactJS while maintaining high code quality and adherence to best practices.
